# An-evaluation-of-Art-Synthesis-on-modern-GAN-models

## Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) image synthesis is one of the most influential topics in recent years,
and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is undoubtedly one of the influential contributors
to the progression of image synthesis. While there are many different variations of the GAN
model that can synthesize high-quality images with very different components, the overall
architecture still stays true to the GAN model of having a Generator (G) and a Discriminator
(D). However, existing GAN image synthesis models that produces images from a noise image
have neglected Art synthesis as the amount of literature about GAN models that step into
the field of art generation is very limited in terms of quantity. This paper will delve into the
differences between real life such as pictures of humans, birds, and cars, and art images and
utilize a modern image synthesis model, StyleGAN2-ADA PyTorch version, to evaluate the
generated art images.
